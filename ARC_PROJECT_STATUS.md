# ARC Project Status and Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks the development and current status of our ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenge solution.

## Current Components

### Core Modules
1. `grid_ops.py`: Basic grid operations
   - Object detection
   - Grid transformations
   - Value counting
   - Grid property analysis

2. `pattern_testing.py`: Pattern detection framework
   - Symmetry detection
   - Progression analysis
   - Repetition detection
   - Spatial pattern analysis

3. `transform_analysis.py`: Transformation analysis
   - Value mapping analysis
   - Object transformation detection
   - Spatial relationship analysis
   - Global vs local transformation detection

4. `transform_predictor.py`: Output prediction
   - Pattern-based prediction
   - Transformation application
   - Multi-step transformation handling

5. `enhanced_reasoning.py`: Main reasoning library
   - Combines all analysis capabilities
   - Handles prediction generation
   - Provides explanation generation

6. `enhanced_recipe_tester.py`: Testing framework
   - Continuous testing
   - Statistics tracking
   - Recipe generation
   - Success analysis

### Environment Setup
- Using conda environment defined in `environment.yml`
- Python 3.10 base
- Key dependencies:
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * jupyter

conda activate arc_env
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run enhanced recipe tester
python enhanced_recipe_tester.py
```

### Checking Results
- Test results are saved in `results/`
- Visualizations are saved in `visualizations/`
- Logs are in `enhanced_recipe_testing.log`
