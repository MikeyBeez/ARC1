The second row of each output has a 1 in the position where there is a 1 in the corresponding column of the first row of the input and a 0 in all other positions. The third row of each output is the same as the first row of the input.\n\nApplying this pattern to the new input, we get:\n\nInput: 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 X X X X 1 (first row of input is changed to 1s and the length of output equals that of input)\n0 0 0 0 0 (third row of input is copied as it is)\n\nTherefore, the solution grid would look like:\n\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 X X X X 1\n0 0 0 0 0",
