# Cognitive System Metrics & Testing Results

## Overview
This document tracks the cognitive development of our learning system through ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) test results and other metrics.

## Baseline Test Results
Date: 2024-11-30

Initial ARC test results will be recorded here after first run.

## Progress Tracking

### Test Runs
Each test run will be logged here with:
- Date/Time
- Tasks attempted/completed
- Success rate
- Notable improvements
- Areas needing focus

### Learning Impact Analysis
After each learning cycle, we track:
1. Changes in abstract reasoning capability
2. Pattern recognition improvements
3. New problem-solving strategies learned
4. Error patterns and corrections

## Graph Database Impact

### Knowledge Graph Metrics
- Number of nodes
- Relationship types
- Connection density
- Pattern clusters

### Correlation Analysis
We track how changes in the knowledge graph correlate with:
1. ARC test performance
2. Response quality
3. Reasoning depth
4. Novel solution generation

## Test Categories

### Pattern Recognition
- Grid transformations
- Sequence completion
- Visual pattern mapping

### Abstract Reasoning
- Rule inference
- Analogy application
- Constraint satisfaction

### Problem Solving
- Strategy generation
- Solution optimization
- Error recovery

## Notes & Observations
Important insights and patterns will be documented here.
